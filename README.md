Detecting Gender Biases in Generated Responses using BERT
This repository provides a framework for detecting gender biases in responses generated by large language models. The approach leverages BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) in a two-step process:

1. Fine-Tuning on Gender-Specific Data:
Collect a dataset containing responses generated by large language models.
Annotate the data with gender labels or utilize existing gender-specific datasets.
Fine-tune a BERT model on this dataset, framing the task as a binary classification problem to predict the gender associated with each response.
2. Bias Analysis:
Employ the fine-tuned BERT model to analyze the generated responses.
Evaluate the model on the responses to identify instances where gender biases may be present.
Utilize the model's predictions to compare against actual gender labels, if available, to identify biased cases.
3. Attention Mechanism Analysis:
Leverage BERT's attention mechanism to understand which parts of the input text contribute more to gender predictions.
Analyze attention scores to identify words or phrases consistently associated with specific gender predictions.
4. Post-Processing Techniques:
Implement post-processing techniques to mitigate biases in the generated responses.
Adjust the generated text based on identified biases to promote neutrality and reduce influence from gender stereotypes.
Please note that effective bias detection and mitigation depend on the quality and representativeness of the training data. Ethical considerations should be prioritized when working on bias detection and mitigation in AI systems.
